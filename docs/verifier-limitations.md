# Verifier limitation roadmap

Pinned Verus verifies 557 obligations with zero errors and zero native
assumptions. The production inventory contains 269 directly verified functions
and 234 reviewed verifier limitations. Each limitation is bound to the exact
source-file hash in `proof-dispositions.json`.

The limitations are not algorithm stubs. They are complete, tested production
functions whose direct proofs are blocked by unsupported pinned-Verus/vstd
surfaces: fallible `Vec` allocation, `HashMap`, `RefCell`, trait callbacks,
slice coercions, formatting, and `std::io`.

## Mitigation order

1. **Fallible allocation foundation**
   - Upstream or locally audit a minimal `try_reserve_exact` contract.
   - Wrap allocation in one reusable verified abstraction.
   - Close bitmap constructors first, then reference/profile/Huffman/MMR
     allocations.
2. **Deterministic verified stores**
   - Replace proof-facing `HashMap` operations with sorted/indexed vectors.
   - Separate `Read` acquisition from verified slice parsing.
3. **Concrete entropy and raster state**
   - Replace `RefCell` and dynamic callbacks with concrete decoder-state enums
     and methods.
   - Reuse the verified arithmetic, Huffman, MMR, and bitmap kernels.
4. **End-to-end raster proofs**
   - Close generic/refinement and halftone entry points after bitmap allocation
     is verified.
5. **Dictionary/text proofs**
   - Close continuous arithmetic, refinement aggregation, Huffman alignment,
     placement, and composition end-to-end.
6. **Non-algorithm boundaries**
   - Keep formatting and platform I/O outside codec correctness claims, or add
     narrowly reviewed native contracts when vstd support exists.

## Governance

- No disposition may be removed without a passing pinned-Verus run.
- Any body change invalidates its disposition hash and fails CI.
- New native contracts require architecture review, a named trust-boundary
  entry, and an updated proof attestation.
- `external_body`, `assume`, and `admit` remain prohibited for codec
  algorithms.
- Progress is measured by reducing `reviewed-verifier-limitation` while keeping
  `incomplete` and native assumptions at zero.

The machine-readable workstreams, counts, priorities, and exit criteria are in
`proof-limitations-plan.json`.
